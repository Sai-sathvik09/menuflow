Use this prompt with an AI image generator like Midjourney, DALL-E 3, or a UI/UX design tool to establish your brand's visual identity.

**The Prompt:**

> Create a UI/UX design showcase for a friendly and lovable digital menu app called "MenuFlow". The brand aesthetic is modern, clean, and incredibly appetizing.
> 
> 
> **Color Palette:** Use a warm, food-inspired theme. Focus on colors like **saffron yellow, paprika red, creamy beige, sage green, and a deep eggplant purple** for accents. The background should be a soft, textured cream or light beige, reminiscent of parchment paper or a clean ceramic plate.
> 
> **Elements to Showcase:**
> 
> 1. **Customer Menu Screen:** Displaying a vibrant menu for a taco street vendor. Show high-quality photos of tacos, playful icons for "spicy" or "vegetarian", and clean, readable typography.
> 2. **Owner Dashboard:** A tablet view showing live orders. Use the color palette to indicate order status: a soft yellow for "New", a gentle orange for "In Preparation", and a satisfying sage green for "Ready". Include charts for "Top Selling Items" that are simple and colorful.
> 3. **Kiosk Interface:** A mockup of a vertical, self-service kiosk screen. The interface should have large, touch-friendly buttons and a simple, step-by-step ordering flow. Feature a "Pay Here" button with a credit card icon.
> 4. **Branding Element:** A close-up of a stylish QR code stand on a wooden restaurant table. The stand should feature the "MenuFlow" logo, which is friendly and uses a playful, rounded font.
> 
> **Overall Style:** Soft UI with subtle drop shadows, rounded corners, and delightful micro-interactions. The feeling should be efficient, joyful, and make you hungry.

### **Part 2: The Comprehensive System Architecture & Features Prompt**

This is the master prompt for a developer, architect, or for yourself to use as a blueprint. It includes all your specified features.

**The Prompt:**

> Project Blueprint: "MenuFlow" - A Centralized Hospitality Tech Platform
> 
> 
> **Vision:** To create a unified web and mobile platform for food vendors (from street stalls to full-service restaurants) that streamlines ordering, enhances customer experience, and provides powerful business analytics. The system is designed as a centralized technology that can be deployed via QR codes, a web portal, and physical kiosks.
> 
> **I. Core Interfaces:**
> 
> 1. **Customer QR/Web Interface:**
>     - Accessed by scanning a QR code or visiting a direct URL.
>     - Instantly loads a visually customized menu (styles, fonts, backgrounds based on owner's subscription).
>     - Allows item selection, modification, and cart management.
>     - Transmits the finalized order to the Owner Portal.
> 2. **Owner/Staff Portal (Web & Android/iOS App):**
>     - **Dashboard:** Real-time sales summary, active order count.
>     - **Live Order Management:** A real-time feed of all incoming orders. Must support status updates (New, Preparing, Ready, Completed).
>     - **Menu Editor:** Intuitive tool to add/edit items, photos, prices, and toggle availability ("Sold Out").
>     - **UI Customizer:** Interface to select themes, fonts, and backgrounds for the customer menu based on subscription tier.
>     - **CRM & Analytics:** Dashboard for Most/Least Ordered, Average Order Value, and advanced AI insights.
> 3. **Kiosk Interface (Future Expansion):**
>     - A locked-down version of the customer interface designed for a dedicated touchscreen device.
>     - Features large, accessible buttons and a clear, guided ordering flow.
>     - Must support integrated payment hardware (card reader).
> 
> **II. Key User Workflows:**
> 
> 1. **Street Vendor "Queue Busting" Workflow:**
>     - Vendor places multiple QR codes on the shop's wall or waiting area.
>     - Customers in line scan a QR code on their own phone.
>     - They browse the menu and place their order, receiving a unique order number (e.g., #58).
>     - The order appears on the vendor's Live Order screen. The vendor prepares the food and calls out the number.
>     - The customer collects their food, enjoys it, and then pays at the counter by referencing their order number. This minimizes ordering time at the window.
> 2. **Restaurant "Table Service" Workflow:**
>     - Each table has a unique QR code that is pre-programmed with its table number (e.g., Table 12).
>     - A customer scans the QR, and their order is automatically associated with "Table 12".
>     - The order is sent to the kitchen/bar display with the table number clearly visible.
>     - A waiter, using the Owner Portal on a tablet, can also view "Table 12's" tab and add items on behalf of the customer (e.g., a second round of drinks).
>     - When the customer is finished, the owner/waiter selects "Bill Table 12" in the portal. The system calculates the total.
>     - Once the bill is paid and the transaction is closed in the system, the "Table 12" session ends, and it becomes available for a new order.
> 
> **III. Subscription Tiers & Analytics:**
> 
> - **Starter (Street Vendor):** Core QR menu, live order list, basic menu customization.
> - **Pro (Restaurant):** All Starter features, plus table-specific QR codes, full order status management, waiter portal access, and **Basic CRM** (Most/Least Ordered, AOV).
> - **Elite (Custom/AI):** All Pro features, plus access to the **Advanced AI Analytics Dashboard** (Waiting Time Prediction, High Traffic Analysis, Peak Performance Item analysis, custom date range history) and Kiosk Mode support.
> 
> **IV. Technical Mandate:**
> 
> The architecture must be scalable, real-time, and designed as a single, centralized backend that serves all interfaces (Web, Mobile, Kiosk) via a robust API.
>
