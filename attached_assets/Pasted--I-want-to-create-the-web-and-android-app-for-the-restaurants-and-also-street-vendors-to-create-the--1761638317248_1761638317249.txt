 I want to create the web and android app for the restaurants and also street vendors to create the menus which will be useful for the customers and also owners and it has two interface like their will the owners portal and another is customer where when they scan the qr code it will redirect it into the menu bar where they will select the items and  the menus will be in different types based on the user selection of the subscription model which will be like three types for street vendors ,restaurants,custom based on the selection the customers can see the menus and owners portal their will be features like live orders,edit menu option,crm option where they can see the most orders ,least ordered ,avg order value and also for the custom based they will be having advanced features like what will be the waiting time for the orders ,which is the high trafic time  and what is the most ordered in that time  these will be defined by using the ai ,order history based on the time range.these menus can have selective options for the style,font and background and ui based on the options


give me the prompt for using the replit use the food related colors as the background or any purpose rather than the general colors and also give me the prompt which should have all the features  and then when we expand we are thinking of the koisiks so based on that it should be also integrated in it so that it will be as the centralized tech rather than an individual my main target is that for street vendors to decrease the order time in the line like we will stick more than one qr on the walls of the shop so they can take the order with instruction and they can enjoy the food and after that they can pay the money at counter.And for the restaurants we will be placing the each qr at the table and each will be having the table number so when the customer what to order through the menu or if the waiter whats to add he ccan add using the table through the portal so it will be convient and also reduce the time and also for the analyatics we will be charging more based on the customiztion and also for the restaurants based on your knowledge suggest me how many types of model i can propose based on the tables and one thing when they get billed the new order will be started
